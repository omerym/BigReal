## BigReal Data Type:

BigReal is a custom data type designed to handle arbitrary precision real numbers in C++. It offers a range of operations including addition, subtraction, and comparison. Here are some key features of BigReal:

Arbitrary Precision: BigReal can represent real numbers with arbitrary precision, allowing for accurate calculations with very large or very small numbers.
    
Mathematical Operations: Perform arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction on BigReal numbers with ease.
    
Comparison Operations: Compare BigReal numbers using standard comparison operators (e.g., <, <=, ==, !=, >, >=).
    
Flexible Usage: Integrate BigReal seamlessly into your C++ projects to handle real numbers with precision requirements beyond the capabilities of built-in types.
